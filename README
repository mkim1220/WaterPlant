attached are two activities: WaterPlant and WaterLog

along with their respective .java and .xml files, the screens will require the .png image sources
currently named "calendar.png" and "garden.png"- both of these images are of course static fillers
so they are not critical

right now, the username and date passed into the WaterLog activity are both hardcoded- if we are 
implementing a fully-functional login with this iteration of the project, the hardcode should be
changed, otherwise it is fine

similarly, the WaterLog activity contains dummyRecords to populate the list of recent waterings
so that when the user presses the water button, they are not the only record that shows up
